you found one then comment on that issue with the details of how you want to contribute. Or if

want to contribute. If your work is approved then only start your work.

on something else then create a new issue to let me know the details.

- Clone the forked repo and set the upstream to the original repo `main` branch.
- Open the solution in Visual Studio 2019 and start working.
- Work on the issue and commit the code on the new branch.
- Create a pull request from the new branch to upstream `main`.
